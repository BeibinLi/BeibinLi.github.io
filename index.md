<br> 

As a second-year Ph.D. student at University of Washington, I focus on computer vision and machine learning. 
I work with Prof. Linda Shapiro and Prof. Frederick Shic to diagnose and intervene Autism Spectrum Disorder by using eye tracking, facial expression detection, and augmented reality. 
I also work on medical data analysis including MRI, fMRI, and fNIRS. I want to create elegant mathematical and novel algorithmic methods to solve hard problems with few labeled data.
