MISSY: I stink!
SAMMY: This is “rain"
MISSY: I really, really stink!
SAMMY: They will do “giraffe” later. It is very funny.
MISSY: I’m gonna make myself puke I stink so bad!
SAMMY: The giraffe is very important to the Ju-Hounsi. Each village has its own “animal celebration.” The giraffe is a healer. [Pause.] You do not stink too bad. I can hardly smell you.
MISSY: Sammy ... I gotta have a bath! A real bath, or I’m gonna vomit! I smell like my dad after he’s been out riding the tractor all day. I know I’m supposed to be experiencing your culture and all, and I don’t mind roughing it, but--
SAMMY: You do not like “rain?”
MISSY: No ... that’s not it at all! It’s fascinating! It really is! It’s just ... I stink so bad I can’t concentrate. I can’t appreciate anything right now. I’m too busy stinking! Can we please go back to the village? Please? Sammy? We’ll come back tomorrow night!
SAMMY: You will miss “giraffe?”
MISSY: You can tell me about it!
SAMMY: That is not the same. You should stay and tell all your friends.
MISSY: I’ll tell them about “rain.”
SAMMY: Your parents would be disappointed.
MISSY: I think I saw some water back there.
SAMMY: They want you to experience Africa!
MISSY: A waterhole or something.
SAMMY: Oh ... you cannot bathe there.
MISSY: Why not?
SAMMY: Too many lions.
MISSY: Oh.
SAMMY: Aafaa did not bring your bath this morning?
MISSY: No, he did. He brought it. It’s just that I’m not used to rationing out my water. I’m used to wasting it, you know? I’m used to swimming pools and hot tubs and–
SAMMY: No. I do not know.
MISSY: Well, by the time I brushed my teeth and washed my socks and my underwear, I hardly had enough water left to wet the sponge!
SAMMY: You should wash first.
MISSY: I know, but I didn’t want to brush my teeth in bath water. And I was afraid if I brushed my teeth first, my panties would smell like crest.
SAMMY: [Under her breath.] That might be an improvement ...
MISSY: What?
SAMMY: Nothing. Oh! Watch this!
MISSY: Is this “giraffe?”
SAMMY: No. “Rain.” [They watch the dance in silence. MISSY tries holding her nose.] You see that one over there?
MISSY: Over where?
SAMMY: There. That one. With the Spear.
MISSY: Yeah?
SAMMY: I think he likes you.
MISSY: How can you tell? [Pause.] Oh my!
SAMMY: He seems very interested.
MISSY: I’ll say.
SAMMY: He is very cute.
[SAMMY begins to rock slowly to the rhythm of the drums. She closes her eyes and lets the music wash over her. A CAT appears. The animal should not actually be present on stage, but should rather be represented by a special lighting effect. Perhaps a tight, red spotlight. The “cat” approaches MISSY.]
MISSY: Oh! A kitty! Come here, Kitty. Come here. It’s okay. I won’t hurt you. [She picks the animal up, strokes its back. It begins to purr contentedly.] There you go. Do you like that? You just needed some attention, huh? Was everybody ignoring you? If you were a giraffe I bet you’d be getting lots of attention! What a good kitty you are. Yes, you are. What’s your name? Do you have a name? You sure are a cute little thing. You want to come back to the village with me? Huh? We could watch out for each other, you know, I could scratch behind your ears, you could show me where all the good watering holes are. You look like you know your way around. I don’t suppose you know where I could find a nice, hot bath, do you? No? Well, it was worth a shot. At the moment, I’d be willing to do just about anything for a bath. I guess I’m talking to the wrong animal though. You don’t have to bathe. You just lick yourself clean. I may have to try that. Yes, I may have to-- [MISSY suddenly realizes that the dancing has stopped. She freezes. SAMMY is sitting very still.] Why is everyone staring at us?
SAMMY: I don’t ... [Notices the cat.] Oh!
MISSY: What?!
[Enter BUSHMAN. He stops a short distance from MISSY. Studies her. Turns back to the others and makes a series of short clicking sounds.]
SAMMY: Put it down.
MISSY: What’s he saying?
SAMMY: They think you’re a witch.
MISSY: What?! I’m not a witch! Why do they think I’m a witch?!
SAMMY: Put it down.
MISSY: What–the cat?
SAMMY: Yes.
MISSY: But it’s just a--
SAMMY: Put it down! Only a witch will pick up a strange cat!
MISSY: Oh. Woops. [MISSY drops the cat.] Go away, Kitty! Go away! See! I’m not a witch! I’m just a stupid person! Really! [The CAT rubs against MISSY’S leg, purring loudly.] Go away! Shoo!
[Suddenly, the BUSHMAN darts towards MISSY, trying to shoo the cat away. MISSY screams. THE BUSHMAN screams. He jumps back and crouches down low.]
SAMMY: Why did you do that?!
MISSY: Do what?!
SAMMY: You scared him!
MISSY: I scared him?! Would you please tell him I’m not a witch! [SAMMY makes a series of clicks. THE BUSHMAN responds and mimes petting the cat.] What’d he say?
SAMMY: Yes you are.
[THE BUSHMAN directs another series of clicks offstage.]
MISSY: What’s he saying now?
SAMMY: He says the cat has possessed your soul. You have embraced the darkness.
MISSY: What?! That’s ridiculous! How could I embrace the darkness?! I don’t even like Halloween! Seriously, I used to binge really bad! I’d eat all my candy in one night! Bags and bags of little Snickers bars and tootsie rolls! I almost choked to death one Halloween on a Bit-O-Honey, so I have some bad associations with-- [THE BUSHMAN motions for MISSY to sit.]Okay. Sure. No problem. I’ll just sit right here. [THE BUSHMAN exits. He returns almost immediately carrying a hot coal between two sticks. He offers the coal to MISSY.] What’s that?
SAMMY: A rock from the fire.
MISSY: Oh ... that’s very pretty.
SAMMY: He wants you to take it.
MISSY: It looks hot.
[THE BUSHMAN clicks.]
SAMMY: If you are a witch, it won’t hurt.
MISSY: No. Thank you. Really. [THE BUSHMAN insists. MISSY puts her hand near the rock but does not touch it.] Ooh! Ouch! Owwie! [Pause.] I burn easy. [To SAMMY.] Help me! [SAMMY and THE BUSHMAN converse. SAMMY seems quite taken with THE BUSHMAN. Her clicks become more flirtatious. THE BUSHMAN likes this. They both laugh.] What? What is it? What’s so funny?
SAMMY: He says he likes you, so you can have the water test instead.
MISSY: Oh! The water test! Yes! YES!!! Thank you! Water! That sounds much better!
SAMMY: The Ju-Hounsi have water even in long droughts.
MISSY: They must be very resourceful! [To the BUSHMAN.] The water test will be just fine. Thank you very much.
SAMMY: He will hold you under--
MISSY: Hold me under?!
SAMMY: That’s right. Until you cannot breathe. And if you are a witch--
MISSY: Now hold on! Hold it right there! I am not a witch! You got that?! I’ve seen The Wizard of Oz! I know what a witch looks like, and it’s not very flattering to be mistaken for one! So you can take that rock and ... and ... stick it up your ... [The BUSHMAN has prostrated himself on the ground.] What’s he doing?
SAMMY: He thinks you have put a curse on him.
MISSY: Really?
SAMMY: Yes. Keep talking.
MISSY: Oh ... ahh ... okay ... I’ll ... I’ll get you, my pretty! And your little dog too! [Suddenly MISSY charges THE BUSHMAN, waving her arms in the air and making all kinds of strange noises. He cowers, clicking like crazy.]What’s he saying now?
SAMMY: He says the cat has given you great powers.
MISSY: That’s right, buddy! GREAT powers!
SAMMY: He says he can smell the stench of evil.
MISSY: The stench of evil! That’s right! Wait a second ... that’s me! He smells me! Oh my god! I knew it! I told you I stink!
SAMMY: He also says you have enchanted him.
MISSY: What ... what does he mean by that?
SAMMY: He thinks you’re a hottie.
MISSY: Really? [SAMMY nods.] You think I’m a hottie? [The BUSHMAN nods, still cowering. MISSY grins.] He is kind of cute.
SAMMY: Yes, he is.
[SAMMY clicks. The BUSHMAN nods.]
MISSY: What did you say?
SAMMY: I told him you wish to be free of the cat’s evil curse. [The BUSHMAN clicks.] He wants to know what he can do to help?
MISSY: Water! Tell him I need water! I ... I have to wash away this evil spell!
[SAMMY clicks. THE BUSHMAN nods.]
SAMMY: He will bring water.
[The BUSHMAN turns to exit.]
MISSY: Wait!
SAMMY: What?
MISSY: Tell him to have his friends bring it. Tell him he has to stay here to protect us from the cat! [SAMMY clicks. The BUSHMAN nods.] Okay, let’s have some dancing! I want to see “giraffe!” [SAMMY clicks and the dancing resumes. The BUSHMAN sits on the ground between MISSY and SAMMY. MISSY takes one arm. SAMMY takes the other. The BUSHMAN grins widely.] This is “giraffe?”
SAMMY: Yes. This is “giraffe.”
MISSY: [She laughs.] You’re right! It is funny!
