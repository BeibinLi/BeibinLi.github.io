Myla: What’s wrong, love?
Rim: I’m hungry.
Myla: Then eat. I don’t mind.
Rim: But it’s the last one.
Myla: It’s okay.
Rim: What about you ? Aren’t you hungry? 
Myla: Not really.
Rim: I cannot believe it’s the last one.
Myla: It had to happen sooner or later.
Rim: I was hoping for much later.
Myla: Check under the table. Maybe it fell down there.
Rim: Found it! Time to eat… sure you don’t want. What is this ! The hunger games ! Was I just imaging there was a can there? I am that hungry.
Myla: Maybe.
Rim: Or maybe someone took it.
Myla: Stop, stop, you’ll make me have to pee.
Rim: Hand it over!
Myla: Okay, okay.
Rim: you sure you don’t want any.
Myla: Nope.
Rim: Don’t you dare. You’ll make a mess.
Myla: The last can.
Rim: Afraid so.
Myla: Or maybe it is the first meal before the feast.
Rim: The feast ? 
Myla: The feast that’s waiting outside/
Rim: Maybe the radiation fried up all the critters and turned them to jerky?
Myla: Too bad you are a vegetarian
Rim: And all the fruit is all dried up and ready for consumption.
Myla: And the water sparkles and bubbles like Perrier.
Rim: But you don’t like Perrier.
Myla: I’ll drink anything we can find that isn’t plain old bottled water. I’m so sick of bottled water. I miss bubbles.
Rim: I can make bubbles in your water.
Myla: Ew, not those kind.
Rim: I wonder what it’s really like outside.
Myla: Not sure. The monitor still shows radiation.
Rim: We’re out of food. Water is about out too.
Myla: Time to start recycling.
Rim: You don’t mean… ew. I think I’d rather deal wit the radiation.
Myla: Thank you for sharing.
Rim: Of course. I always do.
Myla: You’ve always shared everything with me.
Rim: You are my favorite person. I wanted to give you the best of everything… and the best of me.
Myla: You always did… and you stayed with me to the end.
Rim: It’s not the end… not yet.
Myla: I remember when they said the bombbs were coming… I was all alone. 
Rim: I  was terrified we wouldn’t be together.
Myla: Everyone was driving out of the city, trying to get far away from targets.
Rim: I was driving the other way.
Myla: They wanted to arrest you… force you to go.
Rim: Nothing was going to keep me from you.
Myla: I wasn’t going in the shelter without you.
Rim: I remember I found you on the porch, sitting and looking up at the sky.
Myla: I wondered what it would have looked like… all the missiles in the sky.
Rim: I crashed the car in to that big tree in the yard.
Myla: I was so glad you weren’t hurt. You scared me.
Rim: I was in a hurry. No time for brakes.
Myla: That would have been an ironic ending to your trip home. Crashing and dying.
Rim: I did not have a scratch on me.
Myla: We were meant to be mole people together.
Rim: Burrowed together in our little nest.
Myla: I like our little nest.
Rim: I think I have been happier here than I’ve ever been before.
Myla: Me too.
